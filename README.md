====

A resource tracker for decentralized communities.

Inspired by how opensource communities work, Uteo (Swahili word meaning tray) aims to build up on that by helping such communities track and share resources spread over across various regions inwhich they operate. From Uteo, community event organizers will have vaious points of contact whenever they need resources for an event.

Features:
* Show/update resource available in a specific region
* Indicate resources that can be shared / transferred among regions
* Indicate resource status eg available, loaned, donated etc
